**Hypersync and Polars Example**

This repository contains an example of using Hypersync to collect Ethereum events from the USDC contract, and then processing those events with Polars.

The first script, `usdc-volume.py`, uses the Hypersync library to connect to the Ethereum network, query for specific logs (in this case, transfer events), and write them to a Parquet file. The script sets up a query that targets the USDC contract address and filters by topic to capture only Transfer event types.

The second script, `calculate-volume.py`, uses Polars to read in the decoded_logs.parquet file generated by the first script, calculate the sum of the "value" column (which represents the amount transferred), and then divide this total value by 6 to get an estimate of the dollars value. This is a simple example of how you might use Hypersync and Polars together to process large amounts of event data.

**Getting Started**

- Install `hypersync` and `asyncio` libraries using uv or pip: `uv pip install hypersync asyncio`

Once installed, simply run each script in turn to see how they work together. The first script will generate a Parquet file containing decoded logs from the USDC contract, while the second script will process that data and print out an estimate of the dollars value.
